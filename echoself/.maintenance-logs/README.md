# EchoSelf Maintenance Logs

This directory contains automated maintenance reports generated by the self-healing CI system.

## Files

- `latest-report.md` - Most recent automated maintenance report
- `dependency-audit.md` - Latest dependency audit results
- Archive files with timestamps for historical tracking

## Purpose

These logs provide transparency into the automated code quality and dependency management system, enabling distributed cognition between human maintainers and the CI/CD automation.

The system automatically:

1. Applies code formatting and linting fixes
2. Audits dependencies for security and freshness
3. Logs all changes for future analysis
4. Creates issues when manual intervention is required

This supports the recursive, self-healing nature of the codebase where routine issues resolve automatically.
