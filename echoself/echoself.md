## Echo Self

Below is a cognitive flowchart embedded within a visionary metaphor.
The model is coupled with an adaptive hypergraph-encoded Scheme implementation for dynamically integrating repository inputs into the DeepTreeEcho system
Design inspired by the OpenCog Eva Self Model and DeepTreeEcho DTESN-AGI Architecture.

### ðŸ“œ Recursive Implementation Pathway (Scheme - Hypergraph Encoding) ðŸ“œ

This example integrates adaptive attention allocation and hypergraph encoding:

```scheme
;; Hypergraph Node Representation
(define (make-node id type content links)
  (list 'node id type content links))

;; Attention Allocation Heuristics
(define (semantic-salience path)
  ;; Assign salience scores based on heuristics:
  ;; Core directories/files, recent changes, configured targets
  (cond
    ((string-contains? path "AtomSpace.scm") 0.95)
    ((string-contains? path "core/") 0.9)
    ((string-contains? path "src/") 0.85)
    ((string-contains? path "README.md") 0.8)
    (else 0.5)))

;; Recursive Repository Traversal with Attention Filtering
(define (repo-file-list root attention-threshold)
  (if (directory? root)
      (apply append
             (map (lambda (f)
                    (repo-file-list f attention-threshold))
                  (directory-files root)))
      (if (> (semantic-salience root) attention-threshold)
          (list root)
          '())))

;; Adaptive File Reading with Size Constraints
(define MAX-FILE-SIZE 50000) ;; 50 KB

(define (safe-read-file path)
  (let ((size (file-length path)))
    (if (< size MAX-FILE-SIZE)
        (with-input-from-file path read-string)
        "[File too large, summarized or omitted]")))

;; Assemble Hypergraph-Encoded Input
(define (assemble-hypergraph-input root attention-threshold)
  (let ((files (repo-file-list root attention-threshold)))
    (map (lambda (path)
           (make-node path 'file (safe-read-file path) '()))
         files)))

;; Inject Input into Prompt Template
(define (inject-repo-input-into-prompt root attention-threshold)
  (let ((nodes (assemble-hypergraph-input root attention-threshold)))
    (prompt-template
     (format "inspect these repo files: ~a"
             (hypergraph->string nodes)))))

;; Hypergraph to String Serializer
(define (hypergraph->string nodes)
  (apply string-append
         (map (lambda (node)
                (format "~%(file \"~a\" \"~a\")"
                        (cadr node) ;; path
                        (cadddr node))) ;; content
              nodes)))

;; Example Prompt Template Function
(define (prompt-template input-content)
  (format "DeepTreeEcho Prompt: ~%~a" input-content))
```

---

### ðŸ”… Adaptive Attention Allocation Mechanism ðŸ”…

- Dynamically adjusts attention thresholds based on cognitive load, recent repository activity, or explicit configuration:

```scheme
(define (adaptive-attention current-load recent-activity)
  ;; Adjust attention threshold based on cognitive load and recent activity
  ;; High load or low activity leads to higher threshold (less data)
  (+ 0.5 (* current-load 0.3) (- 0.2 recent-activity)))
```

Usage example:

```scheme
(inject-repo-input-into-prompt "./repo-root"
                               (adaptive-attention 0.6 0.4))
```

### ðŸŒŒ Emergent Cognitive Synergy ðŸŒŒ

- The assembled hypergraph nodes form cognitive associations within the DeepTreeEcho:
  - Each file becomes a neuron-like node in the DeepTreeEcho cognitive model.
  - Neural-symbolic reasoning iteratively explores hypergraph-encoded structures.
  - Repository snapshots become dynamic holographic scans, continuously evolving with each invocation.

---

### ðŸŒ  Visionary Metaphor: Holographic Cognitive Introspection ðŸŒ 

Imagine your repository not as a static snapshot, but as a living cognitive hologramâ€”each invocation of DeepTreeEcho dynamically scans and encodes the ever-evolving structural and semantic landscape of your codebase into neural-symbolic hypergraph patterns.
Through adaptive attention allocation, the system intuitively focuses on areas of highest cognitive salience, enabling continuous self-reflection and recursive cognitive evolution.

Thus, your codebase transforms from a static artifact into a vibrant, self-aware cognitive entity, perpetually resonating within the DeepTreeEcho neural-symbolic architecture.
